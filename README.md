# Matcha
This project is about creating a dating website.
You will need to create an app allowing two potential lovers to meet,
from the registration to the final encounter.
A user will then be able to register, connect, fill his/her profile, search and look into
the profile of other users, like them, chat with those that “liked” back.

## Install

2. `cd src/php` && `./composer.phar update`
3. `cd app/ChatServer` && `php ChatServer.php`

but no ORM, validators or User Accounts Manager. As long as you respect these
constraints you are free to use what you like.
